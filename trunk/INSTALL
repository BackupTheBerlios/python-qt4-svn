--- Instalation instructions

Pre-requisites:
   - Qt4, with all headers and qmake
   - Python (>=2.3) development headers and libraries
   - Boost (v2) library

Quick install:
   1   - edit the "setup.pri" and ajust the paths and values to correct ones
   1.5 - edit the "libs.pri" just if needed (advanced user)
   2   - run qmake
   3   - run make

*Atention*: There is still no install process. (Help wanted)

You just have to put the "Qt"package on a place where the python interpreter can look for it:  
   - set up the PYTHONPATH enviroment variable (recomended)    
      $ pwd
      /place/where/you/put/sources
      $ export PYTHONPATH=`pwd`:$PYTHONPATH

   - the "site-packages" dir
      ex:
      $ cp -r Qt /usr/lib/python2.3/site-packages/
