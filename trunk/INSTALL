Pre-requisites:
- Qt4, with all headers and qmake
- Boost library
- Python development headers

Quick install:
1 - edit the "path.pri" and ajust the paths to correct ones
2 - run "qmake"
3 - run make

There is still no install process. You just have to rename the lib to "Qt.so" and put it on a place where the python interpreter can look for it:
- the "site-packages" dir
- set up the PYTHONPATH enviroment variable
