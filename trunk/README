---+ Qt4 bindings for Python
Author: Eric Jardim <ericjardim@gmail.com>

---++ About python-qt4
Qt4 bindings for Python using Boost.Python. The goal is to make a very pythonic 
API but taking advantage of the power of Qt. Another goals are: QtDesigner 
integration, C++ embedded Python Widgets and an extensive documentation with 
demos and examples.

---++ About Qt
Qt is a comprehensive C++ application development framework. It includes a class 
library and tools for cross-platform development and internationalization.

---++ About Python
Python is an interpreted, interactive, object-oriented programming language. It is often compared to Tcl, Perl, Scheme or Java.

Python combines remarkable power with very clear syntax. It has modules, classes, exceptions, very high level dynamic data types, and dynamic typing. There are interfaces to many system calls and libraries, as well as to various windowing systems (X11, Motif, Tk, Mac, MFC). New built-in modules are easily written in C or C++. Python is also usable as an extension language for applications that need a programmable interface.

The Python implementation is portable: it runs on many brands of UNIX, on Windows, OS/2, Mac, Amiga, and many other platforms. If your favorite system isn't listed here, it may still be supported, if there's a C compiler for it. Ask around on news:comp.lang.python -- or just try compiling Python yourself.

---++ About Boost.Python
Boost.Python, a C++ library which enables seamless interoperability between C++ and the Python programming language. The new version has been rewritten from the ground up, with a more convenient and flexible interface, and many new capabilities, including support for:
    * References and Pointers
    * Globally Registered Type Coercions
    * Automatic Cross-Module Type Conversions
    * Efficient Function Overloading
    * C++ to Python Exception Translation
    * Default Arguments
    * Keyword Arguments
    * Manipulating Python objects in C++
    * Exporting C++ Iterators as Python Iterators
    * Documentation Strings
